## 40 Strategies for failing at opensource
- Don't opensource
- Solve a problem that does not exist
- Soft fork: 
- Use analogies
- Nitpick and become hostile:- nitpicing is not picking the right battles
- Create a logo using paint
- Using Google+ to market your stuff
- Find out where the community hangs out and uninstall the application: (you should adjust on how people want to communicate rather than how you want to communicate)
- Allow too much customization
- Be the sole maintainer 
- Attach meaning to github stars - no correlation between stars and users
- See open source as your CV
- A haircut is as good as a holiday - (a change is as good as a holiday) - take vacations from coding
- Be too shy to do any talks.
- Get carried away with features - Adding features nobody asked for
- Leave the company that paid you to work on opensource
- When you leave, take the opensource project burden with you
- Add features no user requested
- Give 110% to opensource
- Add projects no user requested
- Make another soft fork
- Refuse to involve others who want to help
- Find a bunch of new interests
- Burnout
- Don't set healthy boundaries
- Attach your self-worth to opensource
- Never plan for succession
- Don't write tests
- Have no CI - YOLO
- Let new maintainers get started witha Massive change
- Have no consensus mechanism
- Don't have any time at work dedicated to an opensource project that needs support, and is used by the same company where you are working
- Decision paralysis
- Inevitable burnout
